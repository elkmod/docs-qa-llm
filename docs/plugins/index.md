# Extensions

As a Shopware developer, your main work will be to **develop extensions** that **enhance** or **modify** the functionality of Shopware in a specific way. Shopware offers different ways of extensions, each with their own benefits and implications. To make sure you don't get lost within all the options, take a look at the [Overview](overview) article which compares the approaches.

Alternatively, if you want to dive straight in, take a look at our introduction guides:
